We were going to represent the Infectious Diseases Division and we were going to put together fun educational activities for the general public. We held several serious meetings. When the year turned, and we realized how little time was left we really got serious and really started making plans. Then COVID-19 happened. Here are some of the activities we had planned for ASF2020 and will work on for ASF2021. We will continue to try to bring scientific discovery and engagement to the Atlanta community.</p><h2 id=bacteriophages>Bacteriophages</h2><p><img src=/images/ASF2020-image1.png alt="Figure 1"></p><p><strong>Figure 1</strong> - Phages attaching to the surface of a bacterial cell, sometimes only with tail fibers and other times with tail fibers and baseplate.

They are the most abundant lifeform on Earth, numbering more than 1031 at any one time. They are not only critical players in the world’s ecosystems, contributing to nutrient cycling by bursting bacteria to release their contents back into the environment, but also important for shaping the evolution of the planet’s microbes. Phages can also carry bacterial DNA as a payload, thus moving new genes from donor to recipient bacteria upon infection. While phages have these substantial roles on their own, they also have multiple human relevant purposes. In industrial roles, they can foul bacteria-dependent processes, such as yogurt production, leading to economic losses, but they can also be used to deliver genes to bacteria and to present proteins for high-throughput screening of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions. Though they are important in regulating the gut microbiome by themselves, under human application, they can be used to treat infections, including those caused by drug-resistant bacteria. This is called “phage therapy”.</p><h4 id=what-did-we-plan>What did we plan?</h4><p>We planned a paper phage construction activity based on templates designed by Harvard postdoc Sian Owen. We scored and cut phages in cardstock using a die cutter (CriCut) at the Emory makerspace (TechLab). We hoped visitors would build these by folding and taping the capsid and tail and then take them home for display.</p><p>Here are links to get started:</p><ul><li><a href=https://youtu.be/_dFwzh8NzPM>Our YouTube Video Demonstration</a></li><li><a href=https://design.cricut.com/landing/project-detail/5e65af5fdc11ad07be3bb53d>CriCut template for cutting/scoring the cardstock</a></li><li><a href=https://scholar.harvard.edu/sianowen/paper-bacteriophage-template>Sian Owen’s original template</a></li></ul><h2 id=genome-assembly>Genome assembly</h2><p><img src=/images/ASF2020-image2.png alt="Figure 2">

DNA can be sequenced by synthesis, in which nucleotides are extended along a template and sensed by either corresponding pulses of light or base-specific colors, or by displacement through a protein nanopore, in which drawing DNA through the pore causes changes in electrical current across it that can be converted into sequence information. However, even today, sequencing technologies are limited in the amount of DNA sequenced in a single reaction (a “read”). While reads extend between 50 bp (base pairs) and 10,000 bp or more, genomes are often many times larger (1,000,000 bp or larger for bacterial genomes and 3,000,000,000+ bp for the human genome). This means many reads need to be sequenced and combined to generate a genome sequence from sequence reads. The process of combining sequencing reads into contiguous sequences (contigs) is called assembly. In one assembly approach, overlapping sequences identified between reads determine edges in a directed graph called an overlap graph. The contents of the nodes and directions of the edges direct the construction of a contiguous sequence from the first overlap to the last, thus assembling reads into a single sequence.</p><h4 id=what-did-we-plan-1>What did we plan?</h4><p>We split a text phrase (“The Atlanta Science Festival”) into k-mers (subsequences of length k, in this case 5) with each k-mer offset by 2 characters relative to the next one. We printed these 5-mers on magnetic sheets and planned to have visitors arrange these into the correct sequence on a magnetic whiteboard. We also hoped to assemble the pangram “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” and add in a few “sequencing errors” as substituted k-mer characters.</p><p>We created a <a href=https://youtu.be/q0BEopmp_FY>YouTube video</a> of the assembly procedure being completed.</p><h2 id=microbial-diversity>Microbial diversity</h2><p><img src=/images/ASF2020-image3.png alt="Figure 3"></p><p><strong>Figure 3</strong> - This stunning fluorescent image captures the diverse community of bacterial species that can colonize teeth!

Diversity among microbes can occur within a single species or across complex multispecies communities. For instance, the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus has a range of characteristics or phenotypes that allow it to sometimes be a harmless commensal bacteria or a dangerous pathogen. When part of a microbial community, S. aureus can sometimes be outcompeted by other species like Streptococcus pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, but occasionally it can coexist with these same species as they work together to access nutrients or evade the host immune system. We study microbial diversity by conducting experiments in the lab with one or more species and by analyzing tens of thousands of sequenced bacterial genomes.</p><p>One of our planned activities for ASF 2020 aimed to visually demonstrate one of the leading hypotheses on how microbial diversity can help protect a host against infection. By using multicolored pom-poms to create ‘communities’ of varying levels of diversity we could show how community diversity is measured and how diverse communities are more resilient to change when a new species is introduced compared to communities with less diversity.</p><p>We created a <a href=https://youtu.be/2eZXaQH0aII>YouTube video</a> showing the latter part of this activity was filmed and shared on the ASF twitter page.</p><ul class=pa0></ul><div class=mt6></div></section><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div class="flex justify-between"><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://read-lab-confederation.github.io>&copy; 2026 EMERGENT</a><div><a class=resp-sharing-button__link href="https://bsky.app/intent/compose?text=Check out EMERGENT, a bacterial genomics and metagenomics blog from Timothy Read's group! https://read-lab-confederation.github.io" target=_blank rel=noopener aria-label="Share on BlueSky"><div class="resp-sharing-button resp-sharing-button--bluesky resp-sharing-button--large"><div aria-hidden=true class="resp-sharing-button__icon resp-sharing-button__icon--solid"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M12 10.8c-1.087-2.114-4.046-6.053-6.798-7.995C2.566.944 1.561 1.266.902 1.565.139 1.908.0 3.08.0 3.768c0 .69.378 5.65.624 6.479.815 2.736 3.713 3.66 6.383 3.364.136-.02.275-.039.415-.056-.138.022-.276.04-.415.056-3.912.58-7.387 2.005-2.83 7.078 5.013 5.19 6.87-1.113 7.823-4.308.953 3.195 2.05 9.271 7.733 4.308 4.267-4.308 1.172-6.498-2.74-7.078a8.741 8.741.0 01-.415-.056c.14.017.279.036.415.056 2.67.297 5.568-.628 6.383-3.364.246-.828.624-5.79.624-6.478.0-.69-.139-1.861-.902-2.206-.659-.298-1.664-.62-4.3 1.24C16.046 4.748 13.087 8.687 12 10.8z"/></svg></div>Share on BlueSky</div></a></div></div></footer><script src=/dist/js/app.3fc0f988d21662902933.js></script><script src=/js/custom.js></script></body></html>
