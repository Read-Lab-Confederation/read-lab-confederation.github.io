These huge datasets offer the possibility of large-scale mining to reveal species-wide patterns of genetic variability in a manner analogous to the way that vast biobanks of human genomic data are powering deep GWAS studies and GISAID has opened the door for SARS-CoV2 genomic analysis.</description></item><item><title>OK Google, How do I Learn Data Science?</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bt-google_grad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bt-google_grad/</guid><description>Something that delights me as a data scientist is that concepts and techniques are very readily shared within the community. It&amp;rsquo;s also astounding to me that each and every day we have access to an infinite body of knowledge which can help supplement formal and informal learning - namely, that we can gain a lot of information very quickly by turning to Professor Google! Investigating how we as scientists search this seemingly endless collection of facts and figures and code blocks, and for what exact purposes, can give some great insights into how we communicate and learn and ultimately improve our reseach.</description></item><item><title>An introduction to running Bactopia on Amazon Web Services</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/aws-bactopia-intro/</link><pubDate>Sat, 15 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/aws-bactopia-intro/</guid><description>Bactopia is a software pipeline for complete analysis of bacterial genomes, developed by Robert Petit. Bactopia is based on the Nextflow bioinformatic workflow software. One of the many virtues of Nextflow is its adaptability to different compute environments, so I thought I would play around a bit with Amazon Web Services (AWS).
AWS Strategies AWS offers the advantages of paying only for what you ask for/use and having potentially vast scalability.</description></item><item><title>Using AWS Batch to process 67,000 genomes with Bactopia</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bactopia-aws-and-67000-genomes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bactopia-aws-and-67000-genomes/</guid><description>In 5 days, I processed 67,000 Staphylococcus aureus genomes using Bactopia and Amazon Web Services (AWS). What would have taken 6 months using our local resources, was done in less than a week&amp;rsquo;s time. (magical)
More importantly, in October 2019 I received an AWS Cloud Credits for Research award that expired on October 31, 2020. I had plenty of time, plenty. Well&amp;hellip; yeah&amp;hellip; out of nowhere October 2020 shows up and is all like &amp;ldquo;OH HIIII!</description></item><item><title>The strain of defining the bacterial strain</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/strain-definition/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/strain-definition/</guid><description>Introduction: A strain by any other name &amp;hellip; Large-scale sequencing is giving us a clearer picture of what bacterial species are - clusters of core genomes with more similarities to each other than other species’ clusters. Horizontal gene transfer can make the boundaries more or less fuzzy but using metrics such as average nucleotide identity 1,2, in the majority of cases, we can clearly see when two genomes are not in the same species.</description></item><item><title>Genetics of strain-specific levels of toxin production in *Staphylococcus aureus*</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/kyle-michelles_paper/</link><pubDate>Mon, 11 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/kyle-michelles_paper/</guid><description>(This article was written as part of Kyle&amp;rsquo;s Emory REAL program studentship with the lab)

Extracellular toxins play a central role in many Staphylococcus aureus infections. However, producing toxins can take resources away from other cellular functions, and may in fact limit bacterial growth and come at a negative fitness cost.</description></item><item><title>2020 Atlanta Science Festival :(</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/asf2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/asf2020/</guid><description>In March this year we were looking forward to putting together a booth for the group’s first Atlanta Science Festival. We were going to represent the Infectious Diseases Division and we were going to put together fun educational activities for the general public. We held several serious meetings. When the year turned, and we realized how little time was left we really got serious and really started making plans. Then COVID-19 happened.</description></item><item><title>Bacterial strain names and Biosample IDs</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bacterial_strain_names/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bacterial_strain_names/</guid><description>The public databases maintained by NCBI and other members of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) are central resources for bacterial bioinformatic analysis. Two key concepts to know about working with these databases are BioProject and BioSample. These were created1at NCBI as genome data began to gush in, at the beginning of the 2010s following the development of “second generation” sequencing technologies. The structure is mirrored between the INSDC databases, although IDs for the same data can be different.</description></item><item><title>Seven significant bacterial genomics papers from the 2010s</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/genomics_papers_2010s/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/genomics_papers_2010s/</guid><description>If you recognize the birth of bacterial genomics as the 1995 publication of the complete genome sequence of Haemophilus influenzae Rd1then the field reached the beginning of the 2010s in adolescence and by the end of the decade had matured into adulthood. Much of the progress was driven by the steadily increasing output and decreasing costs of the workhorse Illumina short read sequencing platform. This meant more genomes per dollar, and with higher per base coverage, relatively few errors in the assembled portions of the genome.</description></item><item><title>Getting to grips with Nextflow</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/basic-nextflow-script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/basic-nextflow-script/</guid><description>What is Nextflow and why do I need it? A recent blog post identified three components of modern bioinformatics that elevate a user from an early stage code hacker to an efficient power user. These are containers, cloud computing and workflow software. The other two components will be discussed in other posts but the focus here is on workflows, which allows you to string together programs in reproducible, optimized pipelines that ultimately save time (and money if you want to scale up analysis to the cloud one day).</description></item><item><title>Introduction to Bioconda on MacOS / Linux</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/conda-intro/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/conda-intro/</guid><description>Introduction to Bioconda on MacOS / Linux By Tim Read, October 2019
What? Over the past few years, conda, an open-source package manager, has seen rapid growth in the number of available programs it distributes (via Anaconda Cloud). A useful feature of conda is it allows programs to be separated into channels. Bioconda is one of these channels specializing in maintaining bioinformatic software.
Why? Installing open source software from source (ie the files containing the programs) is hard and time-consuming and often futile.</description></item><item><title>Genomics of MRSA evolution and persistence on the human body</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/mrsa-evolution-persistence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 06:45:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/mrsa-evolution-persistence/</guid><description>Read TD, Petit III RA, Yin Z, Montgomery T, McNulty MC, David MZ. USA300 Staphylococcus aureus persists on multiple body sites following an infection. BMC Microbiol [Internet]. 2018 Dec 5;18(1):206. Available from: https://doi.org/10.1186/s12866-018-1336-z
Microbiologists know surprisingly little about the dynamics of bacterial life on the human body: how strains are acquired, how they move between body sites and how long it takes for them to die off or be replaced. This is because, until recently, we didn’t have the genetic tools that allow us to say whether two bacteria from the same species shared a last common ancestor 2 months ago or 1000 years ago.</description></item></channel></rss>
