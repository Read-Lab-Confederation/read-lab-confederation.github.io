### *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA)
The Gram-positive bacterium *S. aureus* is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infection in the US.  Research projects have charactized the genomic epidemiology of clinical isolates and used genome-wide association approaches to understand the genetic basis of antibiotic-resistance, toxin production and phage resistance.  We have also developed the “Staphopia” database of whole genome variation in more than 40,000 publically-available sequenced strains.


### *Chlamydia*
Bacteria of the *Chlamydia* genus cause a wide range of infections in humans and animals. In particular, *C. trachomatis* is an extremely common sexually-transmitted infection across the globe.  Our group has performed extensive genomic epidemiology to understand genetic determinants of virulences and track bacterial movement between human body sites.

### Metagenomics
The EMERGENT group is involved in both 16S and shotgun metagenomics studies to understand correlations between microbiome composition and human health.  We are also interested in using metagenome data for pathogen and antibiotic-resistance diagnostics and cross-referencing comparative genomics results. Dr Read is on the advisory board of the [MetaSUB urban microbiome project](http://metasub.org) and we have collected environmental samples from the Atlanta subway as part of this project.

### Other Projects
Through a network of collaborations we have studied the genomes of a wide range of bacterial and fungal species and the whale shark (*Rhincodon typus*). Several projects have had a underlying forensics/ diagnotics theme, including analysis of plant/ chloroplast DNA in pollen mixtures.
