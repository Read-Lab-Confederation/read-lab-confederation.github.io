HHMI Gilliam Fellow ('24-'27) | Woodruff Fellow | Centennial Scholar. I study the evolutionary dynamics and competitive interactions between Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus, two bacterial troublemakers that co-infect the airways of people with cystic fibrosis. I combine wet lab experiments with phylogenetics and bioinformatics to understand how these pathogens adapt and outcompete each other over time.

As a DACA recipient and first-gen scientist, I'm passionate about mentoring and advocating for underrepresented students in STEM. Someone once opened a door for me, and I intend to keep it open for those that follow.

When I'm not in the lab or wrangling R scripts, you can find me journaling with too many notebooks, pulling tarot cards, planning my next tattoo, or losing my voice at a post-hardcore concert. Currently based in Atlanta, perpetually covered in cat hair, and always looking for the perfect latte.
