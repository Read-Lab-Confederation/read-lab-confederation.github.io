I'm a recent graduate from the undergraduate Emory College of Arts and Sciences. I've done work related to metagenome analysis and bacterial metabolism and virulence. I'm particularly interested in bioethics and solving the gap that exists between science and society/mainstream media. I love music, and enjoy playing my cello in the Emory University Orchestra.
