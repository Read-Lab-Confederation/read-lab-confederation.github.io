I studied Biology at the University of London and then completed a PhD in Genetics at the University of Leicester (my project centered around barriers to conjugation by *E. coli* plasmids).  I did postdocs at Emory in molecular genetics of bacterial pathogeneisis before moving to become a faculy member at The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR).  Following a spell running the Genomics group of the Navy's Biological Defense Research Research Directorate, I returned to Emory as a faculty in the School of Medicine in 2009.
