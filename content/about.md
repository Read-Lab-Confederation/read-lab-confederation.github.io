EMERGENT is the research group of Timothy Read, based in the [Division of Infectious Diseases, Emory University School of Medicine](http://medicine.emory.edu/infectious-diseases/), and other scientists with similar interests at Emory. The Read lab focuses on population genomics of bacterial pathogens.  Bacterial species consist of vast collection of individual cells, each with histories shaped by mutation and horizontal gene transfer. We are interested in the evolution of virulence, antibiotic resistance and transmissability and the trade-offs, metagenomic analysis of clinical specimens and diagnostic design, andevelopment of bioinformatic tools and databases for rapid genome analysis. Timothy Read is a member of the [Emory Antibiotic Resistance Center](http://antibiotics.emory.edu), on the Advisory Board of the [Emory Investigational Clinical Microbiology Core](https://www.cores.emory.edu/icmc/), and part of the [Population Biology, Ecology & Evolution](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/PBEE/index.html) and [Microbial Molecular Genetics](http://www.biomed.emory.edu/PROGRAM_SITES/MMG/) graduate programs.
