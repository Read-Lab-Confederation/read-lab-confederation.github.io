In a recently published collaboration with Dr. Michael David at the University of Pennsylvania, our group compared the traditional method of sequencing individual colony genomes to sequencing pools of colonies.
Efforts to track the spread of bacterial pathogens typically include collecting samples from potentially infected people, such as skin or nasal swabs.</description></item><item><title>How I freed NCBI antibiogram data from XML</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/parsing_ncbi_antibiograms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/parsing_ncbi_antibiograms/</guid><description>How I freed NCBI antibiogram data from XML TL;DR How I made a tidy data frame of &amp;gt;24,000 bacterial BioSample IDs with antibiograms and linked genomic sequence data using a customized R script.

These huge datasets offer the possibility of large-scale mining to reveal species-wide patterns of genetic variability in a manner analogous to the way that vast biobanks of human genomic data are powering deep GWAS studies and GISAID has opened the door for SARS-CoV2 genomic analysis. Our group developed the Staphopia database of 43,000+ public Staphylococcus aureus genomes in 2017 (Petit and Read 2018) and the Bactopia pipelines for large scale analysis in 2020 (Petit and Read 2020).</description></item><item><title>OK Google, How do I Learn Data Science?</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bt-google_grad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bt-google_grad/</guid><description>Something that delights me as a data scientist is that concepts and techniques are very readily shared within the community.

Extracellular toxins play a central role in many Staphylococcus aureus infections.

The structure is mirrored between the INSDC databases, although IDs for the same data can be different.</description></item><item><title>Seven significant bacterial genomics papers from the 2010s</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/genomics_papers_2010s/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/genomics_papers_2010s/</guid><description>If you recognize the birth of bacterial genomics as the 1995 publication of the complete genome sequence of Haemophilus influenzae Rd1then the field reached the beginning of the 2010s in adolescence and by the end of the decade had matured into adulthood.

What? Over the past few years, conda, an open-source package manager, has seen rapid growth in the number of available programs it distributes (via Anaconda Cloud). A useful feature of conda is it allows programs to be separated into channels. Bioconda is one of these channels specializing in maintaining bioinformatic software.
Why? Installing open source software from source (ie the files containing the programs) is hard and time-consuming and often futile.</description></item><item><title>Genomics of MRSA evolution and persistence on the human body</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/mrsa-evolution-persistence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 06:45:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/mrsa-evolution-persistence/</guid><description>Read TD, Petit III RA, Yin Z, Montgomery T, McNulty MC, David MZ.

Microbiologists know surprisingly little about the dynamics of bacterial life on the human body: how strains are acquired, how they move between body sites and how long it takes for them to die off or be replaced. This is because, until recently, we didn’t have the genetic tools that allow us to say whether two bacteria from the same species shared a last common ancestor 2 months ago or 1000 years ago.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/group/tim-read/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/group/tim-read/</guid><description>I studied Biology at the University of London and then completed a PhD in Genetics at the University of Leicester (my project centered around barriers to conjugation by E. coli plasmids).
