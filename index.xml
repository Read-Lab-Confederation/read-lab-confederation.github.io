I am a recent graduate of the Emory College of Arts and Sciences where I received a B.S. in Biology and Philosophy. I came to Emory with the hope of participating in undergraduate research, and at the beginning of my junior year I had that hope realized when I took course BIO499R.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/group/parul-sharma/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jan 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/group/parul-sharma/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m a Bioinformatics Scientist working on improving pathogen identification and classification using genomic and metagenomic data.

In a recently published collaboration with Dr. Michael David at the University of Pennsylvania, our group compared the traditional method of sequencing individual colony genomes to sequencing pools of colonies.
Efforts to track the spread of bacterial pathogens typically include collecting samples from potentially infected people, such as skin or nasal swabs.</description></item><item><title>How I freed NCBI antibiogram data from XML</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/parsing_ncbi_antibiograms/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/parsing_ncbi_antibiograms/</guid><description>How I freed NCBI antibiogram data from XML TL;DR How I made a tidy data frame of &amp;gt;24,000 bacterial BioSample IDs with antibiograms and linked genomic sequence data using a customized R script. Code and data available on the github site. Antibiograms Antibiotic resistant bacteria continue to become more common worldwide. Diagnosis of antibiotic resistance is a frontline defense for fighting back against these dangerous pathogens. Antibiograms are phenotypic tests used routinely in clinical settings to ascertain the profile of antibiotics that will effectively treat the infection.</description></item><item><title>Meet the Staph: A menagerie of common *S. aureus* reference strains</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/reference_staph_aureus_blog_vr_edits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/reference_staph_aureus_blog_vr_edits/</guid><description>When we want to answer a specific phenotype question about bacteria, we are often left to ask which strain is the best choice? It’s important to have a variety of strain backgrounds for your laboratory experiments because different genetic backgrounds will help to answer different questions. This extends to all manner of living laboratory organisms from C. elegans to larger vertebrates. In the context of human health research, these higher order model organisms have been bred and manipulated to optimize their specific relevance to modeling a human health concern.</description></item><item><title>Help, I have too many genome sequences!</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/derep_blog/</link><pubDate>Fri, 21 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/derep_blog/</guid><description>Said no one, ever. Right? (tl;dr at bottom) In a recent publication(1), we analysed the quorum sensing operon of &amp;gt; 40,000 Staphylococcus aureus genomes to identify recurring patterns of genetic variation. To infer transmission of specific mutations, we were tasked with constructing phylogenies for multiple clonal lineages, each comprising thousands of isolates(1).

These huge datasets offer the possibility of large-scale mining to reveal species-wide patterns of genetic variability in a manner analogous to the way that vast biobanks of human genomic data are powering deep GWAS studies and GISAID has opened the door for SARS-CoV2 genomic analysis. Our group developed the Staphopia database of 43,000+ public Staphylococcus aureus genomes in 2017 (Petit and Read 2018) and the Bactopia pipelines for large scale analysis in 2020 (Petit and Read 2020).</description></item><item><title>OK Google, How do I Learn Data Science?</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bt-google_grad/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/bt-google_grad/</guid><description>Something that delights me as a data scientist is that concepts and techniques are very readily shared within the community.

Extracellular toxins play a central role in many Staphylococcus aureus infections. However, producing toxins can take resources away from other cellular functions, and may in fact limit bacterial growth and come at a negative fitness cost.</description></item><item><title>2020 Atlanta Science Festival :(</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/asf2020/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/asf2020/</guid><description>In March this year we were looking forward to putting together a booth for the group’s first Atlanta Science Festival.

Two key concepts to know about working with these databases are BioProject and BioSample.

The structure is mirrored between the INSDC databases, although IDs for the same data can be different.</description></item><item><title>Seven significant bacterial genomics papers from the 2010s</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/genomics_papers_2010s/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/genomics_papers_2010s/</guid><description>If you recognize the birth of bacterial genomics as the 1995 publication of the complete genome sequence of Haemophilus influenzae Rd1then the field reached the beginning of the 2010s in adolescence and by the end of the decade had matured into adulthood.

This meant more genomes per dollar, and with higher per base coverage, relatively few errors in the assembled portions of the genome.</description></item><item><title>Getting to grips with Nextflow</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/basic-nextflow-script/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/basic-nextflow-script/</guid><description>What is Nextflow and why do I need it? A recent blog post identified three components of modern bioinformatics that elevate a user from an early stage code hacker to an efficient power user.

What? Over the past few years, conda, an open-source package manager, has seen rapid growth in the number of available programs it distributes (via Anaconda Cloud). A useful feature of conda is it allows programs to be separated into channels. Bioconda is one of these channels specializing in maintaining bioinformatic software.
Why? Installing open source software from source (ie the files containing the programs) is hard and time-consuming and often futile.</description></item><item><title>Genomics of MRSA evolution and persistence on the human body</title><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/mrsa-evolution-persistence/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Sep 2019 06:45:13 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/blog/posts/mrsa-evolution-persistence/</guid><description>Read TD, Petit III RA, Yin Z, Montgomery T, McNulty MC, David MZ.

Microbiologists know surprisingly little about the dynamics of bacterial life on the human body: how strains are acquired, how they move between body sites and how long it takes for them to die off or be replaced. This is because, until recently, we didn’t have the genetic tools that allow us to say whether two bacteria from the same species shared a last common ancestor 2 months ago or 1000 years ago.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/group/tim-read/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 12:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/group/tim-read/</guid><description>I studied Biology at the University of London and then completed a PhD in Genetics at the University of Leicester (my project centered around barriers to conjugation by E. coli plasmids).
